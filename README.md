Step 1:
-------

* put picture in `in` folder

Step 2:

logs will appear in `logs` folder.


Notes
-----

* `pip install -r requirements.txt` may or may not work, but the file is there.
* packages I installed to make this script work are as follows:
`sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-matplotlib-data python-numpy python-opencv`
